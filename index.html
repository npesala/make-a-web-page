    <h2>The Basics of Web and HTML</h2>

        <b>Web Overview</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> 
The basics of web include HTML, URLS, HTTP, web apps, and the web itself. 
The browser makes requests via the internet to servers. These requests are using <em>http</em> and <em>servers</em> respond with files that your browser displays <b>Ex: firefox, chrome</b> Servers are computers similar to are but they host files and are not placed on desks. Http is the main protocol that the browser uses to communicate with the servers.

        <b>HTML</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> Hyper Text Markup Language It is the basis of almost every webpage and glues everything together. It is made up of <em>text context "what you see" and markup "what it looks like”</em>. The majority of documents on the web are HTML documents.</p>

        <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> HTML documents are made up of element created by tags.  In HTML we tell the browser the type of each element through tags.  <b>Ex of tags: b-tag: bold, em-tag: emphasis (italics), img-tag: images, br-tag: break (forces HTML to produce multiple lines),p-tag: paragraph (creates invisible box around text) </b> </p>

        <b>Inline and Block</b>
      </div>  
      <div class="section-details">
      <p> Inline ends the current line. <b>Ex: br-tag</b> Block creates an invisible box around the text. <b>Ex: p-tag</b> </p>

 <h2> Creating a Structured Document with HTML
 </h2>

<div class="section-name">
  <b>HTML, CSS and Developer Tools</b>
</div>
  <div class="section-details">
  <p>
HTML controls the structure of the page, while CSS controls style of the page. HTML and CSS are both <em>“languages”</em>. There is also something else called JavaScript which controls the interactive components. To see the structure of a page first you go to file and click tools and then click developer tools to see the structure </p>

  <b>Tree-like Structures</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>

DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree-like structure of the page that programmers use. HTML tags become elements and elements form a tree. Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page. The tree-like structure shows the relationship between a parents and a child element. The tree-like structure is similar to that of a family tree. One mother can have many children and those children can have children. There can also be boxes inside boxes, inside boxes and so on. </p>

<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b>Boxes!</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
Every element is a box, even the images that are not rectangular shaped. Boxes are defined with div tags. </p>

  <b>Sublime Text Editor</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
There are special types of text editor that help programmer program more easily By guessing what tag you may want to use or when you select a tag, it creates a closing tag automatically. </p>

<h2> Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure 
</h2>
<div class="section">
<div class="section-name">
  <b>CSS</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. The 'C' in CSS is the most important aspect. It is a code written to control the “style” of HTML elements. CSS attributes and values website: https://developer.moxilla.org/en-US/docs/web/css </p></div></div>

  <b>Code Comments</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
Code comments are small notes for the developer. Browser will ignore the comments, hence the users will not see them. </p></div></div>

  <b>Importance of Avoiding Repetition</b>
</div>
<div class="section-details"><p>
Repeating the same code can lead to errors when developers want to make a change because the requirements have changed. Developer has to consistently make the same update to the code in all the instances of repeated code, otherwise errors will occur. 
  </p>
<p>
  By avoiding the repetition of code, you get the benefit of consistent behavior in your web page. In addition, avoiding repetition of code obviously saves time.

  <b>Box Model and Box Sizing </b>
</div>
      <div class="section-details">
  <p>

The box model includes contents, padding, borders and margins. HTML elements are box and each box has 4 components. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of the box right. There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues; set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels or set the box-sizing attributes to border-box for every element. </p>
